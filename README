This is a minimal computer. It has an 8 bit accumulator register and 256 memory 
locations.  Each instruction is 11 bits and has a 3 bit opcode and an 8 bit 
immediate operand.

+--------+--------------------+
| opcode |      operand       |
+--------+--------------------+

Here are the instructions:

000   ADD [location] - Add the value at the location to the accumulator and 
                       store the result in the accumulator
001   SUB [location] - Subtract the value at the location from the accumulator and 
                       store the result in the accumulator
010   LDI [value]    - Load an immediate value into the accumulator
011   ST [location]  - Store the current value of the accumulator at the memory
                       address specified.
100   BL [target]    - If the accumulator is less than zero, branch to the target.

Additionally, there is a 'res' keyword that will reserve a data variable.  

To run in simulation (requires iverilog and python 2.7)

./run

To run on FPGA:

python ./compile.py < [source file] > program.hex

The design must be resynthesized in quartus whenever the program is changed.
